# PodcastChatBot
A Podcast Chatbot trained using RAG on a Local LLM


Use Ollama and Langhchain to run RAG and LLAMA 3.1 locally on my PC
Also, I am using a Chroma Vector Database
Remember that because Ollama is a local server on the computer, I need to run ollama serve on another terminal, so start the server.
